<p>Before you can access the SAP Launchpad Service, you first need to subscribe to it as this service is not pre-configured with your trial account.</p>
<p><em>Note,</em> that the SAP Launchpad service offers two types of standard plans. The&nbsp;<strong>Applications Plan</strong> which is used to access your applications from the launchpad. In this case, you need to create a subscription to the SAP Launchpad service, which you will do with the following steps. The 2nd plan is the <strong>Service Plan</strong>&nbsp;which is used to integrate with other services. This plan is not required for the scope of this tutorial.</p>
