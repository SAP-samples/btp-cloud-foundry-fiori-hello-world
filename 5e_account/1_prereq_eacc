**Prerequisites for this Mission**

Ensure that all required systems and components are in place. This means:

**SAP BTP trial account** or **SAP BTP enterprise account** with entitlements to SAP Business Application Studio, SAP Launchpad service (see Managing Entitlements ).

If you are using a Cloud-credit-based SAP BTP account no entitlements are necessary but are aware that you have enough cloud credits or an unused free-tier service plan.
To run this mission part you need to have the SAP BTP account administrator privilege.

**Optional**: Subscriptions for Identity Authentication and SAP Continuous Integration and Delivery. To run the SAP Continuous Integration and Delivery sample also a public GitHub account is needed (e.g. at https://github.com/ )
 

Note for Trial Accounts:

The examples in this mission were built with a BTP enterprise account.

SAP BTP Trial Accounts already have preconfigured a Cloud Foundry runtime environment and a Business Application Studio (development environment).

What's missing is the launchpad service, which is optional for this mission. To use it follow the project board card "For Trial Accounts - Set Up SAP Launchpad Service".
