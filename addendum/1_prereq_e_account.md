**Prerequisites**

Ensure that all required systems and components are in place. This means:

**SAP BTP trial account** or *SAP BTP enterprise account** with entitlements to SAP Business Application Studio and SAP Launchpad service.
Optional: Subscriptions for Identity Authentication and SAP Continuous Integration and Delivery. To run the SAP Continuous Integration and Delivery sample also a public GitHub account is needed (e.g. at https://github.com/ )

If you are using a Cloud-credit-based SAP BTP account no entitlements are necessary but are aware that you have enough cloud credits or an unused free-tier service plan.
To run this mission part you need to have the SAP BTP account administrator privilege.



Note for Trial Accounts:

SAP BTP Trial Accounts already have preconfigured a Cloud Foundry runtime environment and a Business Application Studio (development environment).
What's missing is the launchpad service, which is optional for this mission. To use it follow the set-up guide for Trial Accounts - Set Up SAP Launchpad Service.
