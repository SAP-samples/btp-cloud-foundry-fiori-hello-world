**Introduction**

An SAP BTP Booster is a wizard-based UI, which automates the administration steps to set up BTP services instead of configuring all necessary services manually.
For running this HTML5 mission you need the Booster **"Prepare an Account for HTML5 development"**.


**Prerequisites Steps**

1. Open your SAP BTP Cockpit of your Global Account.
2. Make sure you have the Global Account Administrator role for your Global Account.
Select **"Users"** in the left navigation pane, select your **user name** and click on **"Action"** in the detail view (do not click on the delete icon). A second detail view will open. 
The "Role Collection" "Global Account Administrator" must be assigned to your user.




4. Select **"Boosters"** in the left navigation pane.
5. Search for the booster **"Prepare an Account for HTML5 development"**.
6. Select the Booster.
